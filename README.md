# fractals

This new project will be the opporunity for you to hone your miniLibX skills, to make
you discover/use the mathematical notion of complex numbers and to take a peek at the
concept of optimization in computer graphics.

This projectâ€™s goal is to create a small fractal exploration program. Start by seeing what
a fractal is.
